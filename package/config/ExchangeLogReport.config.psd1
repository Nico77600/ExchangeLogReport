#  This file is read by Invoke-ExchangeLogReport.ps1. It is a PowerShell data
#  file: text between quotes, $true / $false, numbers, and @( ) for lists.
#  Lines starting with # are comments. Relative paths are relative to the tool folder.

    # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Exchange servers. One block per server; their data is consolidated in
    # one database and one report. Usually only Name is needed:
    #   1. run -Mode Discover once on the collector: it reads the real log folders of
    #      every server (moved logs, Exchange on another drive...) and writes them to
    #      ExchangeLogReport.paths.psd1 next to this file;
    #   2. without that file, the default installation folders on C: are used
    #      (\\<Name>\c$\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15, \\<Name>\c$\inetpub\logs\LogFiles).
    # A folder can also be forced here; it wins over Discover:
    #   HttpProxyPath, MapiHttpPath, ImapLogPath, PopLogPath, IisFrontEndPath, IisBackEndPath (W3SVCn folder),
    #   FrontEndReceivePath, FrontEndSendPath, HubReceivePath, HubSendPath, MailboxReceivePath,
    #   MailboxSendPath, EdgeReceivePath, EdgeSendPath, MessageTrackingPath; or a root: ExchangePath,
    #   IisLogPath, LoggingPath, TransportLogPath.
    # Edge Transport servers are detected (registry on the server itself, Edge folders through C$, or
    # -Mode Discover run on the Edge): only their SMTP protocol logs and message tracking are read, no
    # IIS, HttpProxy, MAPI, ActiveSync, POP3 or IMAP4. Role = 'Edge' (or 'Mailbox') forces the role.
    # Account: SYSTEM on an Exchange server, or a domain account that is local administrator of
    # every Exchange server, plus View-Only Organization Management for -Mode Discover (user guide, chapter 1).
